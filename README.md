# Dot-files for zsh üíª

### MotD

_This took way longer than it should have, but I like the result, hope you do too. The terminal window needs to be pretty small width-wise before the formatting is broken so there shouldn't be any problems there. üëç_

_If my skull ascii is too much you could always change the .zshrc to load neofetch install, or do what I do, use both. I have the motd set to load when I use the 'r' alias and I have neofetch set to load when I clear the screen with the 'c' alias. Of course, you can always &lt;control&gt;+l if you want neither._

## Starship prompt configuration file

I've set up the starship.toml config file to have the prompt look like the powerline prompt. I've set it up using iterm2 so the colors may be broken on an other terminal app. Also 'magenta' wasn't working for some reason. Not sure if it's a bug with starship or with iterm2. I got around it by hard-coding the color with a hex color.

![prompt image](/assets/prompt.png)

You'll want these two lines at the bottom of your .zshrc:

```zsh
export STARSHIP_CONFIG=~/path/to/starship.toml
eval "$(starship init zsh)"
```

If you're using my 'new-mac-setup' script, it will automatically retrieve my dot files and so the lines will be there but since my actual dot files are in this repo the 'path/to/starship.toml' is a symlink and you'll want to change that anyway. For reference my symlink is in `~/.config/starship/starship.toml`.

### Where's my minimalist prompt? üßê

This is obviously overboard for some people. You can simply delete the sections you don't want from the 'format' block at the top of 'starship.toml'. You don't have to worry about deleting formatting and styling blocks lower in the file.

_Example_ Delete these lines for a minimalist prompt with only the user name, directories, git branch & status, and last-command status:
