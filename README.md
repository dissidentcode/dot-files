# Dot-files for zsh üíª

### MotD

_This took way longer than it should have, but I like the result, hope you do too. The terminal window needs to be pretty small width-wise before the formatting is broken so there shouldn't be any problems there. üëç_

_If my skull ascii is too much you could always change the .zshrc to load neofetch install, or do what I do, use both. I have the motd set to load when I use the 'r' alias and I have neofetch set to load when I clear the screen with the 'c' alias. Of course, you can always &lt;control&gt;+l if you want neither._
